conservative_dolfin
===================

Postprocessing tools for obtaining enhanced mass-conservation of conforming finite elements in FEniCS/Dolfin. This code is for instance used for all 2d and some of the 3d examples of our paper "Mass-corrections for the conservative coupling of flow and transport on collocated meshes".
